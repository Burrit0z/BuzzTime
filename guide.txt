Ever wanted to check the time, but either (a) don't have a watch, or (b) are in
 a situation where it would be socially awkward to do so? Don't worry, here's a
 solution!

How it works:

All you have to do to figure out the time is press your activation button.
 It will vibrate the time by digit. A long vibration indicates a 5, and a short
 one indicates a 1.

For example, 7 would be vibrated as a long vibration,
 followed by 2 short vibrations. A zero, however, would be 2 long vibrations,
 so it does not get confused with the pauses between digits.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q:If I set my activation gesture to the side button, what about Siri, Apple
Pay, and Accessibility shortcuts?

A: I made sure that these can still be used, don't you worry!

Q: What if I don't want to know the whole time? Say I only want to know the
 minutes?

A: Don't worry, I've got you covered. You can press the Volume Up button to only
 vibrate the hours, and the Volume Down button to only vibrate the minutes.

 Q:What if I'm playing music, and I don't want the tweak to vibrate the time?

A: I've got you covered here as well! If you don't want the tweak to activate,
 you can either hold the button down and adjust the volume like that, or double
 press the volume button to bypass the vibrations.
